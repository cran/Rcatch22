R package for the calculation of [22 CAnonical Time-series
CHaracteristics](https://github.com/chlubba/catch22). The package is an
efficient implementation that calculates time-series features coded in
C.

## Installation

You can install the stable version of `Rcatch22` from CRAN using the
following:

``` r
install.packages("Rcatch22")
```

You can install the development version of `Rcatch22` from GitHub using
the following:

``` r
devtools::install_github("hendersontrent/Rcatch22")
```

## Wiki

Please open the included vignette within an R environment or visit the
detailed [`Rcatch22`
Wiki](https://github.com/hendersontrent/Rcatch22/wiki/) for information
and tutorials.

## Computational performance

With features coded in C, `Rcatch22` is highly computationally
efficient, scaling nearly linearly with time-series size. Computation
time in seconds for a range of time series lengths is presented below.

## catch24

An option to include the mean and standard deviation as features in
addition to `catch22` is available through setting the `catch24`
argument to `TRUE`:

``` r
features <- catch22_all(x, catch24 = TRUE)
```
