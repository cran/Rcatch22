R package for the calculation of [22 CAnonical Time-series
CHaracteristics](https://github.com/DynamicsAndNeuralSystems/catch22).
The package is an efficient implementation that calculates time-series
features coded in C.

## Installation

You can install the stable version of `Rcatch22` from CRAN using the
following:

``` r
install.packages("Rcatch22")
```

You can install the development version of `Rcatch22` from GitHub using
the following:

``` r
devtools::install_github("hendersontrent/Rcatch22")
```

You might also be interested in a related R package called
[`theft`](https://github.com/hendersontrent/theft) (Tools for Handling
Extraction of Features from Time series) which provides standardized
access to `Rcatch22` and several other feature sets in both R and Python
for a total of \>6,600 features (including enabling you to calculate
your own custom features).

## Wiki

Please open the included vignette within an R environment or visit the
detailed [`catch22`
gitbook](https://time-series-features.gitbook.io/catch22) for detailed
information on all the features and implementations in various
programming languages.

## Computational performance

With features coded in C, `Rcatch22` is highly computationally
efficient, scaling nearly linearly with time-series size. Computation
time in seconds for a range of time series lengths is presented below.

## catch24

An option to include the mean and standard deviation as features in
addition to `catch22` is available through setting the `catch24`
argument to `TRUE`:

``` r
features <- catch22_all(x, catch24 = TRUE)
```
