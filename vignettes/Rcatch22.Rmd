```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  fig.height = 7,

)
```

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(Rcatch22)
```

`Rcatch22` is an R package for the calculation of [22 CAnonical Time-series CHaracteristics](https://github.com/chlubba/catch22/) (catch). The package is an efficient implementation that calculates time-series features coded in C.

## Core calculation function

The main function of the package is `catch22_all` which automates the computation of the 22 features. This can be run in a one-liner:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
data <- rnorm(100)
outs <- catch22_all(data)
```

### catch24

An option to include the mean and standard deviation as features in addition to `catch22` is available through setting the `catch24` argument to `TRUE`:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
outs2 <- catch22_all(data, catch24 = TRUE)
```
